# 🧘 Quantum Circuit Samples Using Qiskit and Cirq

This repository contains example implementations of quantum circuits using **Qiskit** and **Cirq**, two widely used quantum programming frameworks.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to:

- Build quantum circuits  
- Apply gates and measurements  
- Visualize circuit diagrams  
- Simulate quantum behavior  
- Display histograms of measurement outcomes  

These examples are intended for learning, experimentation, and comparing how circuits behave across different quantum software tools.

## 🔧 Implemented Features

Each circuit example includes:

### ✔ Circuit Construction
Creating a quantum circuit with the desired number of qubits.

### ✔ Gate Application
Applying a variety of single-qubit and multi-qubit gates to generate different quantum states.

### ✔ Circuit Visualization
Drawing and printing the circuit diagram using built-in visualization tools in Qiskit and Cirq.

### ✔ Simulation
Executing the circuit on a simulator backend for:

- **500 repetitions (shots)**  
- Collecting statistical measurement outcomes  

### ✔ Histogram Output
Displaying the measurement distribution through:

- A standard histogram  
- A second histogram visualization with **red bars**
